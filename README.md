## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


## What I learned

#### I learned how clean and useful using variables in styling can be, and how it can help speed up the process.

#### I learned that it is not necessary to define a class or ID for every HTML tag. To style it like this, we first need to check whether our tag is unique and not repeated. If it is unique and not repeated, we use the name of the same tag in CSS for styling. Like this:

```html
<h1>Improve your front-end</br>skills by building projects</h1>
```
```css
h1{
    font-size: larger;
    font-weight: var(--outfit-bold);
    color: var(--qr-heading-color);
}
```

### Continued development

I like to immerse myself in creating animations with CSS and then move on to creating various functions with JavaScript.


### Useful resources

- [htmlcolors.com](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - To convert a color value from HSL to HEX.
- [www.cssmatic.com](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - So that you can more easily create a box and make it exclusive.
